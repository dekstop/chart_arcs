TODO:
- make a time-variant version where the weekly chart transitions are spread out horizontally along a timeline (as opposed to drawn on top of each other, as done currently)

- get intern usernames
- load data from webservice!

vis:
- point size: accumulated number of consecutive weeks (squared?) that entries remained on this position
- arc strength: number of movements between positions
- BETTER: 
  - arc strength: combined artist reach
  - arc alpha: combined overall artist playcount for this user
- highlight entry/exit points (circle color red/green)
- highlight "mainstream" factor of music?
- find other ways to increase "contrast"; e.g. highlight favorite artist's paths

compare different charts:
- users
- groups
- globalcharts
- commercial/mainstream/sales charts?
